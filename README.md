# Diabetes Risk Analysis

## Project Description

This project analyzes a diabetes risk dataset to uncover key patterns, relationships, and insights that can inform healthcare decision-making. The dataset includes features such as blood glucose levels, BMI, physical activity, medication adherence, stress level, sleep hours, hydration level, and more, alongside a calculated risk score.

The primary objectives of this project are:

*   To load and explore the provided diabetes risk dataset.
*   To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the data, including distributions of key features and correlations between them.
*   To preprocess the data for potential modeling.
*   To visualize the data to gain deeper insights into patterns and trends related to diabetes risk.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `diabetes_data.csv`. It contains 1000 entries with the following columns:

*   `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
*   `date`: Date of the health recording.
*   `weight`: Weight of the individual.
*   `height`: Height of the individual.
*   `blood_glucose`: Blood glucose level.
*   `physical_activity`: Level of physical activity.
*   `diet`: Dietary information.
*   `medication_adherence`: Adherence to medication.
*   `stress_level`: Stress level.
*   `sleep_hours`: Hours of sleep.
*   `hydration_level`: Hydration level.
*   `bmi`: Body Mass Index (calculated from weight and height).
*   `risk_score`: Calculated diabetes risk score.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

*   `diabetes_data.csv`: The dataset file.
*   `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, exploration, analysis, visualization, and modeling.
